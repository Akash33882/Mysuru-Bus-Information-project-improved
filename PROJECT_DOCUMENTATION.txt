================================================================================

1. INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Mysuru Smart Bus Information System is a comprehensive web-based platform 
designed to provide real-time information about city bus services in Mysuru. 
This system addresses common challenges faced by bus passengers such as 
difficulty in finding accurate route information, uncertainty about bus 
timings and schedules, and lack of fare transparency.

The system offers a user-friendly interface accessible from any device with 
internet connectivity. It serves as a one-stop solution for all bus-related 
information in Mysuru city, built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.


2. OBJECTIVES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:
• Create a centralized digital platform for Mysuru city bus information
• Provide accurate and up-to-date information about bus routes, timings, fares
• Make public bus travel more accessible and convenient for all users
• Promote the use of public transportation in the city

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:
• Route Information: Display comprehensive details of all bus routes
• Timing Details: Present first and last bus timings with frequencies
• Fare Information: Provide transparent fare structure with calculator
• User Experience: Create responsive design working on all devices

• Printed route maps (limited distribution)

PROBLEMS:
• Accessibility Issues: Information not available 24/7
• Information Accuracy: Route changes not updated promptly
• User Inconvenience: Time-consuming to get complete information
• Limited Features: No search, no fare calculation, no feedback
• Resource Intensive: Requires staff and printing costs
